Yet Another Google Docs Template Filler

As the name tells you, this is my variation for filling Google Docs from Google Spreadsheets.

Sorry for the poor code, this is just the initial commit and learned it's even possible to create these Add Ons like 8 hours ago.

Particularly sorry for the Hungarian labels, I'm still to figure out how to do localization.

I only upload this, because as I understand addons are bound to documents, and if the document get deleted, I lose what I wrote.

DEVELOPER KEY has been removed from picker.html. I hope I won't forget to remove it again when I upload it next time :-) Though I'm not sure if I have to do this, as publishing the app would make this key public anyway (as it is part of the client-side code).
